If the user input matches the stored data, the user is authorized to use the website or piece of the website. Authorization includes authenticating the user and passing a token so the user can view or use the intended data. SSO involves using the authorization token to authenticate the user through multiple sign-ins so the user can explore and use all of their intended data without having to log in more than once.",
